The Executor
The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every 
SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes 
to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will 
redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections. 
The figure below shows a command line “A | B | C | D”. If there is a redirection such as “< 
infile” detected by the parser, the input of the first SimpleCommand A  is redirected from 
infile. If there is an output redirection such as “> outfile”, it redirects the output of the last 
SimpleCommand (D) to outfile.

If there is a redirection to errfile such as “>& errfile”  the stderr of all SimpleCommand 
processes will be redirected to errfile
